# Buns...? inator...?
Yes. Some friends and I refer to each other as being "buns" when we demonstrate lack of skill in any particular area.

e.g. Playing VALORANT and missing every single shot: "You're buns, dude."

This term has ingrained itself into our current vernacular and there doesn't seem to be any sign of its usage slowing down.

This game, Buns-inator, was originally meant to be a "jest generator" through which you could click a few options and generate a unique insult that incorporates "buns."

It has since evolved into a full websockets-based online game capable of supporting a lobby of two teams of 5 where both teams compete to create the most interesting, or hilarious combination of words in a party-like game similar to Cards Against Humanity or Quiplash.

`tldr; an inside joke got out of hand and turned into a profitable idea`
